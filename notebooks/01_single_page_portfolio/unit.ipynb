    "This unit focuses on designing and building a complete single-page portfolio website for presenting scientific work. It covers how Hugo uses Markdown content, front matter, themes, and templates to generate a structured and visually consistent homepage. The unit addresses organizing content into clear sections such as biography, projects, publications, and contact information, and shaping the overall appearance through theme configuration rather than custom CSS. It also covers integrating rich media and research artifacts, including images, documents, datasets, videos, and badges, using Hugo’s static resources and shortcodes."
